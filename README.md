This is a simple implementation of a feedforward neural network in c++ without the use of any external library. This, of course, means that matrix multiplication is not optimized and is executed on the CPU, slowing things down tremendously. Initially, the program was meant to process the MNIST dataset, but even this would take too much time on a home laptop. Again, the project is just an excuse to learn something.
